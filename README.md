# Short-URLs-and-Prepopulated-Google-Forms

See https://support.google.com/docs/answer/160000?hl=en for information about pre-filled Google forms.

To get started, pre-fill a form with sample data so that you can get the form ID as well as an entry ID for each entry that you want to populate.

The form ID and entry IDs will be found in the URL that is generated by your pre-filled URL.

This requires Python (of course) and Requests (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/).

If any of this requires clarification, ask @misterhay on Twitter.
